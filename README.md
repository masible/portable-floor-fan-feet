# Portable Floor Fan Replacement Feet

The rubber feet on this efficient portable floor fan degraded to the point that one of them split,  with the others looking like they were on their way. This is a simple no fuss replacement for them.

Print on its side with no supports, in a flexible filament such as TPU. Model is customisable, OpenSCAD source provided.
